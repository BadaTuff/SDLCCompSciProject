## Reflection on Essential Questions

**1. How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?**  
I begin by interviewing or surveying users to gather pain points and feature wishes. Then I translate those needs into user stories with clear acceptance criteria. That format ensures I focus on what the user actually values—each story drives a small, testable slice of functionality and keeps me aligned with real requirements.

**2. How do I approach developing programs? What Agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?**  
I favor incremental delivery: break work into two-week sprints, hold daily stand-ups, and demo working code at each review. In future projects I will continue backlog refinement, planning poker for estimates, and sprint retrospectives to inspect and adapt both code and process.

**3. What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?**  
A strong team member communicates proactively, volunteers help when blockers appear, and respects others’ time by keeping commitments. I strive to give timely feedback, document decisions, and lift morale with encouragement when challenges arise.
